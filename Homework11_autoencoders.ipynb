        "A **transposed convolution** is a type of neural network layer used to increase the spatial dimensions of feautre maps, effectively performing upsampling. Unlike standard convolutions, which typically reduce spatial resolution, transposed convolutions expand it by distributing input values over a larger area using a convolutional kernel. They use the same parameters as regular convolutions (stride, padding, kernel size etc.), but apply them in reverse. This allows the layer to reconstruct the spatial layout of the data rather than the exact original values. Transposed convolutions are commmonly used in tasks like image generation, where recoving the spatial resolution of the output is essential."

        "The **transposed convolution** maps each input value to a larger output area using a kernel. During this processs, the kernel values are multiplied with the input and accumulated at overlapping output positions. When the operation begins, the kernel is places at the top-left corener fo the expanded output space. It performs element-wise multiplications with the overlapping input area, producing a scalar value for that region. The kernel then shifts to the right by a defined stride and repeates the operation until it can no longer move horizontally, at which point it moves down and continues the process row by row until the entire output has been covered. This allows the network to learn how to reconstruct higher-resolution feature maps in a way that preserves spatial structure."
